1.) Install Python

PyLib has been developed for and under Python 3.x. It has been tested with Python 3.7 and 3.8 and we recommended using the latest version of Python on Windows machines or the one that comes with your distribution on Linux. You will also need PIP to install additional libraries that are required by PyLib.

2.) Python lib dependencies:

PyLib makes use of the third-party libraries listed in "requirements.txt", which have to be installed separately. We encourage the use of PIP in a virtual environment.
  
For this purpose, open a terminal window and run the following commands *inside* the folder, in which PyLib resides (i.e., execute `cd /path/to/pylib` before).

  ```
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If you plan to use the image transmission app, additional libraries have
to be installed. Please edit the file "requirements.txt" in this case by
commenting in the relevant part.

3.) Pylib dependencies
```
pip install -e .
```
